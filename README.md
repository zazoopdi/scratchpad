# scratchpad
A simple, writable overlay for streamers and presenters

Built in Godot 4.3

- Copy the files to a new Godot project, then update the following in Project Settings:


-> Display - Window - Viewport Width/Height -> 1920 x 1080

-> Display - Window - Size - Transparent -> True

-> Display - Window - Per Pixel Transparency - Allowed -> True

-> Rendering - Viewport - Transparent Background -> True

- I didn't want to compile it, so you can look at it before deciding to run it - the internet is dangerous!

- It currently wants to be 1920 x 1080 - resizing mucks up the positions of the sidepanel, because I'm still learning :D

Todo
- Build out Erase function
- Make Resizing work!
- Write dots faster, or create a better way to make them in the first place
- (it was only after I got this far that I discovered GPaint, probably would have done well to learn from that first, lol)
- Make it standalone, so people don't need to futz with the project settings
- Would anyone ever care about saving their scribbles?

If you like this, I'd love to hear about it. And if you make it better - thank you <3
